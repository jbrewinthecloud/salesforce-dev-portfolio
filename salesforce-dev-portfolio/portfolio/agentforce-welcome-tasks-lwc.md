# Agentforce Vibes – Personalized Welcome + Tasks Due Today (LWC)

## Problem
Salesforce Home pages are often generic and don’t highlight what the user needs to focus on immediately.

## Solution
Built a Lightning Web Component that:
- Welcomes the logged-in user by name
- Displays how many Tasks they have due today

## How it was built
- Built with Agentforce Vibes (AI-assisted development)
- Lightning Web Components (LWC)
- Salesforce data (Tasks) surfaced in the UI
- Deployed to a Salesforce org using Salesforce DX
